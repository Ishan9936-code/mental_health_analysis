🧠 Mental Health Prediction using Machine Learning
A machine learning project to predict mental health treatment necessity based on survey data. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

📌 Features
✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Encoding)
✔️ Feature Engineering & Selection
✔️ Model Training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
✔️ Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
✔️ Visualizations: Correlation Heatmap

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is Mental_Health.csv
Contains survey responses on mental health treatment
Features include demographic, workplace, and mental health-related factors
🖥️ Technologies Used
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
🔹 Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

📊 Model Performance Metrics
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
